# PokemonGame
All done with any bugs and any other things that made this game not run porperly. All gifs have finally been fixed (see code for that in the Downloader class) and all pokemon gens 1-7 are available to be played. 

From this point, next things to come include:
{-Choosing movesets
-A teambuilder screen}
{-Background for battle area
-Better transitions between pokemon}
-Animations for pokemon entry

Things that will probably not ever be implemented:
-Abilities
-Items

Things that might be implemented (quite hard for me to do but still possible):
{-Status conditions
-Stat boosts}
{-EVs
-IVs
-Level
-Nature} 

If you have any suggestions for me to add let me know and I'll see if I can implement it.

{...} -- > means that those things are easy to implement all at once and probably will be done together
